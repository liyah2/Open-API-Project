Find HeART — Open API Project

This project displays the use of a public API from the Art Institute of Chicago
. It allows the user to search for artworks, view their details, and display images and artist information, all powered by real-time data fetched from the museum’s open API.

How to Run This Project on Your Computer

1. Download the project files
    -Click the green Code button on my GitHub page and choose Download ZIP.
    -Or, if you’re comfortable using Git, you can clone it directly:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/find-heart-openapi.git


2. Unzip the folder (if you downloaded the ZIP)
Once it’s downloaded, just unzip it and save it somewhere easy to find — like your Desktop or Documents.

3. Open it up in your favorite code editor
I recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but you can use whatever editor you like.

4. Run the site locally
    -Inside the folder, look for the index.html file.
    -Double-click it, and it should open right up in your browser!
    -If you’re using VS Code, you can also right-click the file and choose “Open with Live Server” if you have that extension installed — it’s a nice, smooth way to preview your page.

5. Try it out!
    -In the search bar, type something like “Monet”, “cat”, or “landscape.”
    -Click Search and watch as real artworks appear below in the Gallery section — all pulled from the Art Institute of Chicago’s public API.

That’s it! You’re all set to explore and interact with real artwork data right from your browser. Enjoy!
